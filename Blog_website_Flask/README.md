This website is developed using Flask and the database used is SQLite. It is a simple blogging website. I have left the Database link portion empty for anyone wanted to use with their own database by downloading my project. 

The styling has been done by using a free Bootstrap4 theme which you can easily download from their website. Other than that, I have used python version 3 and flask 1.1.2 along with SQLite database.This site hase login,register etc. functionalities too.
